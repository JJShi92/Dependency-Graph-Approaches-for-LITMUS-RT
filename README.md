# Dependency-Graph-Approaches-for-LITMUS-RT 
Implementations for Dependency Graph Approach (DGA) in LITMUS-RT. <br />
<br />
We implemented both Partitioned and Semi-partition Dependency Graph Approaches based on plugin P-FP, named as PDGA and SDGA.<br />
<br />
The implementation is based on LITMUS-RT 2016.1, and it can be transfer to the latest version of LITMUS-RT easily.<br />
